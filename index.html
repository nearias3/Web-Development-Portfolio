            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings!</p>
            <p>I am a passionate software developer with a desire to create intuitive and impactful digital experiences. I hold a B.S. in Radio Television Film from the University of Texas as well as a Master's in Education from Relay Graduate School of Education. My initial career as a teacher honed  my problem-solving skills and instilled a deep appreciation for clear communication and structured thinking. Inspired by a longstanding love for technology, I transitioned into software development by pursuing a certificate from the rigorous UT Coding Bootcamp. This portfolio is a testament to my dedication and the skills I've acquired throughout my coding education. It features various apps I've developed, showcasing my proficiency in fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs. These projects reflect not only my technical abilities but also my commitment to creating user-friendly applications. Take a look at my work below!</p>
